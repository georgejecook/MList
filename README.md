## taken from maestro framework

For more like this, check out the [maestro framework](https://github.com/georgejecook/maestro) for roku.

Maestro is a framework that:

 - uses brightscript like syntax and idioms
 - with all the efficiencies and benefits of the modern brighterscript language
 - making it possible to write in a more mature, and design pattern favouring coding style
 - similar to typescript
 - building off a rock solid roku-centric base
 - which is intuitive for both seasoned scenegraph developers and typescript developers
 - and takes away as much boilerplate as possible
 - so developers spend their time solving their code problem, and not on roku nuances
 - all the while conforming to best of breed roku patterns, to ensure performance and stability
 - while increasing testabillity
 - and capturing as many typos/bugs as possible at compile time


## This project is written in brighterscript

Brighterscript is a fresh, fun, friendly, exciting language we have used at applicaster, and other places for nearly a year. VScode supports brighterscript at the time of writing; and the official compiler is almost finished. 

## but you will not be using brighterscript here, if you don't want to

You can simply copy the tranpsiled brs sources from the build or dist folders.

## Usage

### Run from brighterscript

- npm install the main folder
- change `.vscode/.env` to point to your roku's ip and change the password
- run from vscode, either run or test targets
- Copy the build/source/maestro folder into your project's source folder (i.e you should have source/maestro, in your project).

### Just grab sources and go

- Copy the dist/source/maestro folder into your project's source folder (i.e you should have source/maestro, in your project).

## API

Coming soon (seriously; I document like crazy, this will get done; sharing early for some chums to play with)
